Welcome to The Adventures of Rando, a simple 2D platformer game created with the Godot game engine. This game was developed as a learning project to explore the capabilities of the Godot engine and the GDScript programming language.

## How to Play

The goal of the game is to guide the player character, Rando, through a series of levels and reach the end goal. Rando can move left and right, jump, and attack enemies using the arrow keys and the space bar. The game also includes power-ups and collectibles that the player can collect to gain special abilities or points.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `assets/`: contains art assets and other resources used in the game
- `scripts/`: contains GDScript files that define the game mechanics and behaviors
- `scenes/`: contains Godot scenes that define the structure and layout of the levels

## Requirements

To play this game, you will need to install the Godot game engine on your computer. The game was developed and tested with Godot version 3.2.3, but it should also work with newer versions of the engine.

## Languages Used

- GDScript: a high-level, dynamically-typed programming language used to create scripts and behaviors in Godot
- Godot Scene Description Language (GSDL): a declarative language used to define the structure and layout of Godot scenes

## Credits

- Developed and designed by Marti

I hope you enjoy playing The Adventures of Rando!
